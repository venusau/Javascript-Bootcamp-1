/*
    NORMAL EXECUTION

    1. Executor will wait on the Script to do 2 things 
        1.1 Download the script 
        1.2 Execute the script 
    
        After these 2 things are done the the DOM CREATION RESUMES.


    CONCLUSION: always have the script tag in the last of the body so that 
    out HTML DOM tree is fully Crated.

*/


/*
    Defer EXECUTION

    1. When Executor finds the Script tag It downloads the Script PARALLELY 
    hence the DOM CREATION DO NOT STOP.

    2. After DOM is 100% Created then the DOWNLOADED script starts its EXECUTION.


    // OUR Script.
*/


/*
