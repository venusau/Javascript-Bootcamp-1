// Things we have noticed
// 1. when we have more tabs on chrome, it takes more space in RAM.
// 2. RAM only STORES KEY VALUE PAR ( RAM likes to store OBJECTS).

// We know that when we create a new TAB a new WINDOW (glbal OBJECT) is created.

// A BROWSER TAB CONSISTS of
/*
  1. DOM: Document object model (responsible for the view / html)
  2. JS: responsible for logic (math and Functions).
  3. BOM Browser Object models -> it is collection of functions provided by the browser 
  like localStorage.
